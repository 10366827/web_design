                <h2>The Spanish Arch</h2>
                <img src="images/landmarks/spanish_arch.jpg" alt="picture of galway city">
                <p>The Spanish Arch (Irish: An Póirse) and the Caoċ Arch (Irish: An Póirse Caoċ) in Galway city, Ireland, are two remaining arches on the Ceann an Bhalla ("Front Wall"). The two arches were part of the extension of the city wall from Martin's Tower to the bank of the River Corrib, as a measure to protect the city's quays, which were in the area once known as the Fish Market (now Spanish Parade). It was constructed during the mayoralty of Wylliam Martin in 1584, being called ceann an bhalla (the head of the wall).</p>
                <p>In the 18th century the Eyre family of Eyrecourt, County Galway, created an extension of the quays called The Long Walk and created the arches to allow access from the town to the new quays. The designation "Spanish" is not historical to this period and was likely known as the Eyre Arch when built.</p>

                <h2>The Aran Islands</h2>
                <img src="images/attractions/aran_islands.jpg" alt="picture of galway city">
                <p>The Aran Islands are located about 48km (30 miles) from the mouth of Galway Bay. Inishmore (or Inis Mór) is the largest of the three islands which measures just 14km (9 miles) in length and 4.8km (3 miles) at its widest point. The islands are famous for their prehistoric and Christian monuments including the spectacular Dún Aengus fort that is one of best examples of this type of fort in all of Europe. Other ancient stone forts worth visiting include Dún Eoghanachta and the crumbling Dún Dúcathair. The unique landscape of the islands exhibit a crosshatch of thousands of miles of stone walls and visitors flock to the islands to enjoy the cliff-top walks and spectacular coastal scenery.</p>

                <p>The distinct region of Connemara is located in the north west corner of County Galway. Connemara's breathtaking landscape is a mixture of unspoilt rivers, lakes, woodlands, rich meadowlands, rugged hills, dramatic mountains and stunning coastline of sandy beaches and crystal blue waters. Connemara is a Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking) area, rich in Irish culture, heritage and traditions. The main town in the Connemara region is Clifden. It has lots of quirky shops, restaurants and traditional Irish pubs to explore. Throughout the region there are many very interesting attractions like Kylemore Abbey, Connemara History & Heritage Centre in Clifden, Glengowla Mines in Oughterard, the 40,000 acre Connemara National Park and the set of the film 'The Field' in Leenane, which was directed by Jim Sheridan in the 1990's. Connemara is the ideal place to visit if you want to experience all things Irish. </p>

                <img src="images/attractions/oranmore_castle.jpg" alt="picture of galway city">
                <p>Oranmore Castle dates back to the 15th century and was originally stronghold of the De Burgo clan. Known as 'An Cáislean Mór' or 'The Castle of the Well' it played a major role in the defence of Galway during the Confederate Rebellion in the 1640's when provisions were transported from the castle to the besieged fort of Galway. The castle was abandoned in the mid-1800s until it was purchased in 1945 by Lady Leslie for her daughter, the writer Anita Leslie, whose own daughter, Leonie currenty lives in the castle with her well known husband, the musician Alec Finn of De Danann. A visit to the castle is highly recommended as it offers an enchanting, inviting immersion of art, music and history. Oranmore Castle is open to the public from June to August 10am-2pm (closed Mondays). </p>
